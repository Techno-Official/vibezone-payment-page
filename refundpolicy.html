    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Vibzeo</strong>, a one-to-one audio calling app by <strong>Techzniczone, Bangalore</strong>. This Refund Policy explains our practices regarding payments, coins, and refunds for in-app purchases made within the Vibzeo platform.</p>

    <h2>1. Virtual Coin Purchases</h2>
    <p>All purchases of <strong>Vibzeo Coins</strong> are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>. Once coins are successfully credited to your account, the transaction cannot be cancelled, reversed, or refunded, whether or not the coins are used.</p>
    <p>By completing a purchase, you acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to a refund or compensation for unused or expired coins.</p>

    <h2>2. Failed or Incomplete Transactions</h2>
    <p>If a payment is completed but coins are <strong>not credited</strong> to your account due to a technical issue, please contact our support team within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the transaction. After verification, we will either credit the missing coins or process a refund at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p>To resolve such issues quickly, please provide your transaction ID, payment method, and account details when contacting support.</p>

    <h2>3. Unauthorized or Accidental Payments</h2>
    <p>If you believe that a payment was made <strong>without your authorization</strong> or by mistake, you should immediately contact your payment provider (Google Play Store, bank, or UPI app). Vibzeo cannot directly reverse payments made through third-party processors but will assist you in verifying transaction details when required.</p>

    <h2>4. Technical Issues</h2>
    <p>In rare cases where a technical glitch or service error affects your coin balance or payment experience, please contact us. We will investigate the issue and take appropriate corrective actions, such as restoring lost coins or providing equivalent credit.</p>

    <h2>5. Promotional and Bonus Coins</h2>
    <p>Coins earned or received as part of promotional offers, bonuses, or gifts hold <strong>no cash value</strong> and are not eligible for refunds or exchanges.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Techzniczone reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Updates will be reflected on this page with the revised effective date. We encourage you to review it periodically.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
